# Mnemonic-Phrase-Generator
Program that asks for how many words and their starting letter to generate a mnemonic phrase. Additional features include shuffling the original phrase and entering custom words.

The script is object oriented so you will need to download m16_module to run alongside the main file. I have included a wordlist, however you can use any wordlist available you would just have to change line 69: dictFile = open('wordlist.txt', 'r')
