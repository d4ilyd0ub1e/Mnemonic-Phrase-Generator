Problem Domain - Mnemonic Phrase Generation

Mnemonic phrases are often used in an academic setting to recall information that is otherwise difficult to retain. For example Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
for the order of operations. The programmer will create a solution that will allow a user to enter the number of words in their phrase and the first letter of
each word to create mnemonics.
